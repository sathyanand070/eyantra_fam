# eYRC24-25 Warehouse Drone Theme

## Problem Statement:
The goal of this challenge is to navigate a drone through a warehouse, identifying packages placed at various locations within the warehouse. The warehouse will contain multiple aisles where packages are stored. Participants must use an overhead camera to map the warehouse layout and develop path planning algorithms to move the drone from one point to another. They will be tasked with identifying a specific package and navigating the drone to scan it.

## Implementation:
The challenge will be divided into two phases:
- Simulation: Participants will use the Gazebo simulator to fly the drone and perform a preliminary run of the challenge.

- Hardware: Those who successfully complete the simulation phase may advance to the second stage, where they will receive hardware to replicate their simulation work in a real-world environment.
